# Toyhouse Crawler & API
![Toyhouse banner](https://github.com/MyFursona-Project/toyhouse-crawler/assets/94678583/6ad67bc5-5d97-49b5-9f8d-29b4ce134c5f)

> **Important**
> Toyhouse doesn't have an _official_ API, so we created a scraper to crawl
> and parse data from the site. That way, we can build a robust API for it.
>
> We wrote this because there is no way to extract data from Toyhouse without an
> official Toyhouse API; built for anyone in general, not just strictly
> for [MyFursona][mf].

A [toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se/) scraper written in Python and FastAPI.
